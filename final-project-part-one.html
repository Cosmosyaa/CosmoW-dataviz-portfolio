  <h1>Final Project Outline</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>The Outline / Initial Sketch</h2>
    <p>
      For my final project, I plan to explore Chinese consumers' attitudes toward cultural and creative products. 
      The cultural and creative industry has been rapidly emerging, known for its highly innovative works that span 
      a wide range of styles and appeal to diverse audiences. Through data analysis, I aim to investigate consumer 
      psychology, demographic groups, and the market share of different types of cultural and creative products.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key data I intend to work with includes consumers’ purchase intentions and motivations regarding cultural 
      and creative products, as well as the demographic distribution of consumers—specifically their age, occupation, 
      and the range of how much they spend on cultural and creative products. Additionally, the preferred categories 
      of products within this industry.

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    <p>
      My data comes from MobTech and SeedHangyan, both of which are open-source platforms (access requires only a 
      registered account). The information is primarily in the form of reports and textual explanations, so I will 
      need to extract and organize the relevant data manually.

    <h2>Method and Medium</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I plan to collect and analyze data from open-source industry reports provided by MobTech and 
      SeedHangyan. I will manually extract and organize the relevant information, focusing on consumer behavior and 
      demographics. To visualize and communicate my findings, I will use Tableau to create interactive charts and 
      graphs that highlight patterns in consumer motivations, preferences, and spending behavior. I may also use 
      Shorthand to build a narrative-style presentation of my research outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I’m interested in experimenting with Flourish due to its wide range of customizable chart 
      templates and creative features—such as icons, color adjustments, and interactive elements—which allow for 
      more expressive storytelling. While Flourish offers flexibility and is easy for beginners, I have found that 
      it may have limitations in terms of data depth and professional approaches compared to Tableau. Thus, it may 
      be one of my starting points before I get things systemized in Tableau.
