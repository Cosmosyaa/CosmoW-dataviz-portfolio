<h1>Final Project Outline</h1>

<section>
  <h2>The Outline</h2>
  <h3>Introduction (for the project, not for the presentation)</h3>
  <p>
    For my final project, I plan to explore Chinese consumers' attitudes toward cultural and creative products.
    The cultural and creative industry has been rapidly emerging, known for its highly innovative works that span
    a wide range of styles and appeal to diverse audiences. Through data analysis, I aim to investigate consumer
    psychology, demographic groups, and the market share of different types of cultural and creative products.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key data I intend to work with includes consumers’ purchase intentions and motivations regarding cultural
    and creative products, as well as the demographic distribution of consumers—specifically their age, occupation,
    and the range of how much they spend on cultural and creative products. Additionally, the preferred categories
    of products within this industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the process of collecting data, I noticed that many reports present information almost exclusively through bar graphs—percentages, proportions, quantities, or multi-dimensional comparisons.
    While clear and easy to read, it can often feel visually repetitive.
    Therefore, in my project design, I aim to enhance and diversify the visual presentation of data.
    I want to make the information not only easy to understand, but also engaging and visually appealing, so that it tells a more compelling story.
  </p>

  <h3>Introduction (draft) for Presentation</h3>
  <p>
    An analysis of consumer behavior and preferences in the realm of cultural and creative products in China.
    By exploring key demographic data and emerging style preferences,
    we aim to gain a clearer understanding of how audiences engage with these products—and what that means for future development in this space.
  </p>

  <h3>Introduction for Cultural and Creative Products</h3>
  <h3>Demographic Data</h3>
  <p>Gender, age, education, etc.</p>
  
  <h3>Style / Category Preference</h3>
  <p>
    What kind of category/style people are really into. This aims to show people's aesthetics and preference in functionality or decorativeness.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Potential</h3>
  <p>
    How can these data influence future choice on what to produce and what to promote for.
  </p>

  <h2>Initial Sketch</h2>
  <p>
    This is an example of how I might combine some values together to make the visualization more compelling and fun.
    For instance, although we have data about categories that consumers are fond of, it's clearer to put them in a scale of functionality and decorativeness.
  </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> This is just an initial sketch, not a final version. Limitations will be solved later when I have more data sorted out.</p>

  <iframe title="Consumer Preferences (%) for Cultural and Creative Products Based on Functionality and Decorativeness" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-8rmCe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8rmCe/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="421" data-external="1"></iframe>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    !function() {
      "use strict";
      window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
        if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
          var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
          for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
            for (var r, i = 0; r = e[i]; i++)
              if (r.contentWindow === a.source) {
                var d = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px";
                r.style.height = d
              }
        }
      }))
    }();
  </script>

  <br><br>

  <p>
    I am trying to incorporate a pop-up after clicking the data, to show the name and the percentage of consumers who prefer this category.
    But it's technically not working now, so I am showing both versions here.
  </p>

  <iframe title="Consumer Preferences (%) for Cultural and Creative Products Based on Functionality and Decorativeness (Copy)" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-NanRu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NanRu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="446" data-external="1"></iframe>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    !function() {
      "use strict";
      window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
        if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
          var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe");
          for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])
            for (var r, i = 0; r = e[i]; i++)
              if (r.contentWindow === a.source) {
                var d = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px";
                r.style.height = d
              }
        }
      }))
    }();
  </script>

  <br><br>

  <p>
    I'm also experimenting with more creative graph styles to represent population data.
    This example highlights the differences between various population groups.

  <h2>The Data</h2>
  <p>
    My data comes from MobTech and SeedHangyan, both of which are open-source platforms (access requires only a registered account).
    The information is primarily in the form of reports and textual explanations, so I will need to extract and organize the relevant data manually.
  </p>

  <h2>Method and Medium</h2>
  <p>
    For this project, I plan to collect and analyze data from open-source industry reports provided by MobTech and SeedHangyan.
    I will manually extract and organize the relevant information, focusing on consumer behavior and demographics.
    To visualize and communicate my findings, I will use Tableau to create interactive charts and graphs that highlight patterns in consumer motivations, preferences, and spending behavior.
    I may also use Shorthand to build a narrative-style presentation of my research outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I’m experimenting with Flourish due to its customizable chart templates and creative features.
    Flourish offers flexibility and is easy for beginners, but may have limitations in terms of data depth compared to Tableau.
    Thus, it may be one of my starting points before systemizing everything in Tableau.
