  <h2>Changes Made Since Part II</h2>
  <p>
    I integrated data from multiple dimensions to enrich the overall dataset and create a more nuanced, multidimensional view of consumers. Rather than relying on a static or generalized persona, I focused on illustrating who they are through their actual behaviors, preferences, and decision-making patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe this approach offers a more authentic and dynamic understanding of the target audience, grounded in their real data about how they relate to the products, the culture, and their habits of purchasing.
  </p>

  <h2>The Audience</h2>
  <p>
    My audience consists of people working in the cultural and creative industries—whether developing new products, promoting existing ones, seeking collaborations, or working as designers. It also includes people from competing sectors, such as those involved in traditional souvenir product development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, people from countries other than China working in the cultural souvenir industry may refer to the strategies and audience data, given that China is currently the largest market for Cultural and Creative Products.

  <h2>Final Design Decisions</h2>
  <p>
    As for the design of graphs, I kept my design simple and used the default blue color consistently throughout the whole presentation, changing to orange when showing contrasting sides.
  </p>
  <p>
    All patterns used are from AI-generated images that imitate the style I intended to reference. All product photos are sourced from an e-commerce site that offers free images for non-commercial use.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Shorthand, I made some slides scrollable so that the audience first sees the visualization, followed by my brief explanation overlaying it. The conclusion section is designed to appear progressively, revealing bullet points and key highlights as the audience scrolls.

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the iterations of interviews, I really enjoyed gaining new insights that I hadn’t noticed myself. Many people pointed out things I had overlooked, such as how the call to action should be framed more clearly as suggestions for the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also applied techniques I learned from our in-class PowerPoint Karaoke exercises, like placing the conclusion of each chart in the most prominent spot. Instead of starting by introducing what data I was showing, I highlighted the conclusion at the top to make detailed information easier to grasp.
  </p>
  <p>
    One regret is that during the class presentation, because of rushing and nerves, I forgot to mention that China is currently the largest market for cultural and creative products. Even though this point was included in my shorthand, I didn’t say it out loud, which might have made it harder for my classmates to relate. Still, I hope my clear explanation of the audience helped them understand the context.
