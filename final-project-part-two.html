<h2>Introduction of Cultural and Creative Products (in shorthand)</h2>
<p>Added after interview: My target audience is people who works in the cultural and creative products industry, especially who are considering marketing for their own products and want to identify which product to promote, or those who are considering making new products next year and trying to find directions and trends.</p>
<br></br>

<h2> Consumer Data - Demography (gender, age, education, price sensitivity)</h2>

<h2>Consumer Data - Category preference, style preference</h2>
<p>Intended to use chart with icons to show examples of product and how many people (in proportion) prefers this category. For instance, a cup icon with a percentage, etc.</p>

<h2>Example - what are successful ones in terms of price, style, and functionality (or decorativeness) </h2>
<ul>
<li>By reinterpreting traditional imagery with a modern, playful twist 
  (e.g., turning a stern royal portrait into a “cute” version), the Palace Museum captures the interest of younger audiences and boosts emotional connection.</li>
  <li>Transforming of solemn cultural symbols into relatable and entertaining visuals.</li>
  <li>A wide range of products—from makeup, stationery, souvenirs, to lifestyle goods—ensures appeal across consumer preferences.</li>
<li>The development process includes quick market research, trend-based “brainstorming” with suppliers, limited-batch production, and responsive marketing.</li>
</ul>



<h1>User research </h1>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>My target audience includes individuals involved in the production, marketing, and promotion of cultural and creative products, as well as those seeking to collaborate with IPs in the cultural and creative sector.</p>
<p>This report aims to provide them with up-to-date data and insights to support more informed decision-making, regarding which products to prioritize, what to produce more or less of, how to approach pricing strategies, and how to identify suitable IPs for collaborations with traditional cultural sites or museums.
</p>

<h2>Interview script </h1>
<p>Although I may not be able to directly interview individuals currently working in this specific field, I plan to consult people with experience in areas such as art design and marketing. I will ask for their feedback on whether this report makes sense, whether the data is useful, and if it can support decision-making in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>Their insights will help evaluate the practical value of this research and indicate whether the findings could be applied to product development, marketing strategies, or potential collaborations with cultural institutions. This external input will also help refine the report’s relevance and improve its potential for real-world impact.</p>
  <br></br>
<p> Question(general): When reviewing a report like mine that includes consumer demographics and product category preferences, what type of data do you find most helpful? </p>
<p> Goal:Evaluate which parts of the report (demographic breakdowns, spending range, etc.) are most useful for professionals.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Question(about mine): What do you think works clearest in my report? why?</p>
<p>Goal: to see what works, and the logic of why it works best</p>
  <br></br>
<p>Question(about mine): What are you confused about?</p>
<p>Goal: to adjust the part that may be confusing for first-timers</p>
<br></br>
  <p>Question:(general): Do you think data on age, gender, and occupation influences how market or design of cultural and creative products? If so, how?</p>
<p> Goal: to better evaluate how demographic insights translate into actionable marketing or design strategies.</p>




<h2>Interview findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interviewee 1 asked about specific target audience – maybe include that in the introduction</li>
  <li>Interviewee 1 asked about Call to Action – should be more specific and highligted. My call to action is suggesting people working in cultural and creative product industry to have a sense of what to improve about current condition and what to produce next.</li>
<li>Interviewee 2 asked about including the suggestions from consumers to inprove the product</li>
</ul>
