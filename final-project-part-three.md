# The final data story
<a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/cultural-and-creative-products-in-china/index.html">Final Story in Shorthand</a> 


# Changes made since Part II
> I integrated data from multiple dimensions to enrich the overall dataset and create a more nuanced, multidimensional view of consumers. Rather than relying on a static or generalized persona, I focused on illustrating who they are through their actual behaviors, preferences, and decision-making patterns.
>     
> I believe this approach offers a more authentic and dynamic understanding of the target audience, grounded in their real data about how they relate to the products, the culture, and their habits of purchasing.


## The audience
> My audience consists of people working in the cultural and creative industries—whether they’re looking to develop new products, promote existing ones, seek collaborations, or work as designers.
>   
> It also includes people from competing sectors, such as those involved in traditional souvenir product development.
>   
> People from countries other than China working in the cultural souvenir industry can also be my audience. Since China is currently the largest market for Cultural and Creative Products, they may refer to the strategies and audience data and test their products' market. 



## Final design decisions
> I would keep my design simple and keep the default blue color consistent throughout the whole presentation, and make changes when showing an opposite side – for instance, use orange to contrast with the blue.
>   
> All the patterns I used are from AI-generated images that imitate the style I intended to reference. All the product photos are sourced from an e-commerce site that offers free images for non-commercial use.
>   
>  In Shorthand, I made some slides scrollable so that the audience first sees the visualization, followed by my brief explanation overlaying it.
>   
> The conclusion section is designed to appear as the audience scrolls. The bullet points and key highlights of audience groups are revealed one-by-one as they progress through my Shorthand presentation.
